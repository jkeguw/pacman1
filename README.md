After so many years of development and changes, C++ is still not as simple and clear as young languages ​​- even different compilers require different codes.

This was originally a MinGW code, but I modified it to meet the MSVC standard and abandoned some dangerous codes - because the original code (yes, I'm talking about you, wcscpy) will not compile without additional settings.

I don't ask for a high score, just passing is fine.
